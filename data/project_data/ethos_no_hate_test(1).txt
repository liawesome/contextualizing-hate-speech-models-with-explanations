When are people going to stop asking, “Why are they only coming out &amp saying something now?”    If you have not been sexually,( mentally & emotionally) abused as a child, by an adult You are not going to understand their reasons. If they tell you why, LISTEN!!  Stop asking “Why now?”   One reason victims don't come forward when YOU THINK they should, is bc no one will believe them. Not all cases, a lot of use are like that though. All situations are different with different types of people involved, We all have our reasons. If you're not going to listen, stop asking. You're choosing to be ignorant. Being sexually abused & ALL that comes with it, psychological abuse etc. Forever changes you, You're forever damaged & it can never be undone. Instead of looking at victims as a group, look at them & their story as their own. They're not all the same, & we will not all do the same thing after the damage has been done.;0.0

Trace, I would ask you to rethink the out of Africa myth. Since the out of Africa theory was proposed, there have been many discoveries that prove modern humans existed in other parts of the world much earlier than what was thought when the OOA theory was proposed. For instance, there have been skeletal remains of humans found in Asia that are many thousands of years older than the oldest found on the African Content. It amazes me that there is so much information out there that shows older humans elsewhere on Earth but people still adhere to the falls narrative that modern humans evolved on the African continent;0.0

this is my theory on the whole thing, was Michael strange yes , but his circumstances growing up he didn't have a childhood and I believe he was trying to be a child for the first time , I remember at the time it was happening just wondering why the parents would let their kids sleep with Michael . it is strange for an adult to be sleeping with the kids I know I sure wouldn't but then again I didn't grow up like Michael Jackson. these two men have had plenty of time to come out about Michael and they choose tell after he dies , their families were set up the whole time they were staying at Michael's house and I don't believe anything happened and if it did it was the parents fault more than anyone's would you let your kids sleep with Michael for any cost? I just have to take Michael's side on this since he ain't here to defend himself;0.0

I really like a lot of what you said here. I feel like i can barely speak up about this side of the topic because people are quick to shut down those who try to be too serious about it.  'Anxiety' and 'depression' and 'mental illness' have almost become buzz words. It seems that a lot of people don't know how difficult it is to really suffer and feel out of control of it all.   As you spoke about, there's a fine line these days between awareness and influence. People get ideas in their heads and see the memes and the relateable content and start linking everything to their own lives. Before you know it, you've got perfectly healthy people being tainted by the world and people around them, imposing problems upon themselves and making life more difficult than it needs to be. It desensitises the whole situation and now I have people coming to me with real problems who don't want to speak up because of the upsurge in people talking about it. They feel they wouldn't be taken seriously. And that's horrible.   I do understand though that it's an impossible seesaw to balance since so many people are involved and so many minds with a million ideas and actions are impossible to control and have on the same wave length.;0.0

I don't see why we don't just create a transgender category. Seems the most obvious and fair solution. Great athletes will still compete. And the playing field will be as level as can be.
