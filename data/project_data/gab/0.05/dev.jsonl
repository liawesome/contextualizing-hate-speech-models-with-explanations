{"text": "\"A \"\"spatial skill test\"\" rotating a 3-D object in space proves nothing about whether men or women are better drivers. There are many other skills involved in driving besides spatial skills. A driving test, or accident statistics, do provide more reliable indicators. I was easily able to find data on many driving studies measuring men's ability vs women's. Time and again, the study conclusion was that the perception that men are always better drivers is pure fallacy. The conclusion was that men and women drive differently.   Having different driving skills only means that women are better at some aspects of driving while men excel at others (parking, for example, because of their spatial skills). On the other hand, men of all ages have higher accident and fatality rates because of their more aggressive, risk taking style of driving. Women tend to get into accidents from doing something stupid like distracted driving or forgetting to look for pedestrians. There are good and bad drivers of both sexes.  Here's an article which sums up the results of several \"\"man vs woman\"\" driving studies:  https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-drive/culture/commuting/men-vs-women-who-are-better-drivers/article1389780/\"", "hd": "0", "cv": "0", "vo": "0"}
